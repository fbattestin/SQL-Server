	Title:       Object Type Plan Cache Usage
	Created by:  Mark S. Rasmussen <mark@improve.dk>
	License:     CC BY 3.0
 
	Usage:
	This script gives an overview of what kind of plans are stored in the plan cache.
	A large amount of 'Adhoc' object types indicates a lack of parameterization of
	the queries, causing a bloated plan cache.
