You can read more about row structure and allocation units here: http://aboutsqlserver.com/storage-engine/

The script below provides you the information about space allocation on per-index basis in the database. You can easily modify it to aggregate on per-table basis or drill-down on per-allocation unit basis; however, at that stage I usually prefer to work on the index level.
