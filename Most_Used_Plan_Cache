 Usage:
 This script can be used to get a list of the most used plans in the plan cache.
 These plans are generally the most important ones to make sure are optimized.
 If you sort by CP.usecounts ASC rather than DESC, then you'll get a list of the
 least used plans which may indicate lack of plan reuse.
